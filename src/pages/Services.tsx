                Primordium is a weekly reading group hosted by T.X. Watson, Elli Peacock, Han Koehle, The Woodmother, Kenna Pearl, and Evan Diem. You can tune in for a reading and live discussion of the text on Thursdays at 6:30 p.m. ET. Backing any of these creators on Patreon (click their name) or backing Elli on Twitch (theeclecticlibrary) gets you access to the Primordium Discord server, where you can join the closed-group discussion of the text with participation open to all members! We read science fiction and fantasy short stories, accessible film and literary theory academic papers, poetry, essays, we’ve even done a couple movies and an album!

                The Sunset Oracle Deck
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
                The Sunset Oracle Deck is the current state of a 5-year long project to create a custom fortune-telling deck—Watson was getting into tarot, but wanted to see their own values reflected back at them when they did a reading, rather than those of the collective consciousness of the last 300 years of European mystics. So they made their own!
